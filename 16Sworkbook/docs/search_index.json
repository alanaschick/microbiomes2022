We’ll go through a few of them here. 8.1 Taxonomic Composition First, we make some composition plots of the samples to get a good idea of what’s in them. Start by agglomerating the AVSs to whatever taxonomic level you’re interested in. You can do this with the tax_glom() function. ## Aggolomerate to Phylum level phy &lt;- tax_glom(psf, &quot;Phylum&quot;) 8.1.1 Exercise A - What other data transformations do you think are necessary? Have a closer look at otu_table(phy) to give you an idea. B - Use the plot_bar() function to generate a bar plot for the phylum level composition. C - Use the psmelt() and ggplot() functions to generate the same bar plot. When we look at lower levels of taxonomy (like genus), it is impractical to plot all genera found. It would look like this: 8.1.2 Exercise A - Create a new phyloseq object that contains only the top 10 most abundant genera. Strong hints: use the function sort() to order the genera, then subset the top 20. Following that, use the function prune_taxa() to create the new phyloseq object. B - Change the color of the bars! See this page for inspiration: https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf Lastly, we sometimes want to look at differences between groups, based on the metadata. 8.1.3 Exercise Use the function facet_wrap() to group the samples by: A - Treatment B - Timepoint C - Treatment and SubjectID With the goal or producing a summary like this: 8.2 Alpha Diversity One common way to summarize metagenome results is to report a value of alpha diversity. This concept comes from ecology and there are several ways to measure the diversity within a sample. 8.2.1 Exercise A - Read the R documentation for the phyloseq function estimate_richness(). B - Create a data frame containing the results of the estimate_richness() function and the measures of alpha diveristy you are interested in. C - Create a data frame containing the sample metadata and the measures of alpha diversity you are interested in. D - 8.3 Beta Diversity "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
