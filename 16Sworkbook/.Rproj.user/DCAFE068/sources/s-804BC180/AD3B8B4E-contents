# Introduction

Here is the link to the lecture we will start with today: [slides](microbiomeworkshop.pdf)

## Basics and Background

Our goal is very similar to gathering data on a city neighbourhood to find out who lives there, how the demographic changes over time or in response a drastic event. We can gather more information by asking about neighbours, quality of life etc. Similarly when we are looking at microbial communities our first question is who is there, how abundant and how their presence changes over time or when conditions change. We can also ask questions like how the microbiomes are interacting with each other (metabolites).

Key points are:

- Think of a hypothesis before doing an experiment
- Spend time on experiment design:
  - Sample size, 16s region to amplify, etc.
  - Talk to a bioinformatician
  - Think about the depth of sequencing if you want to capture the less abundant taxa
  - Add negative control to account for contamination
- Thoughtful data analysis is critical for successful identification of microbes

## Data

This dataset is from a study investigating the effect of a prebiotic on the microbiota in children with type 1 diabetes. 

The data about what the samples are (metadata) can be found [here](data/project_metadata.txt). 

Sequence data was generated on the Illumina MiSeq platform, using the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The primers used to amplify this region were:

### Exercise

Read the metadata file into R and inspect it to make sure it makes sense. Do the sample ID's in the file match the file names of the raw sequence data?
