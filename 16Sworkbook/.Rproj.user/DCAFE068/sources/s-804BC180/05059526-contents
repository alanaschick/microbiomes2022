# Pre-workshop

## Installation
  
<b>R</b> and <b>RStudio</b> are separate downloads and installations. R is the underlying statistical computing environment and RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You will need to install R before you install RStudio.

<b> If you already have R and RStudio installed</b>, open RStudio and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is available, quit RStudio and download the latest version of RStudio. To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and check the top of the console to see which version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display the version of R you are running. Go on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install it.

<b> If you don't have R and RStudio installed</b>, please follow the instructions for your operating system below.

### Windows
* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select RStudio for Windows
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

### MacOS
* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install R
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select RStudio for MacOS
* Double click the file to install RStudio
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.
  
### Linux
* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we
  don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
  usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.
* Go to the
  [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

## Datacamp Courses

To help familiarize yourself with R, you have been assigned two Datacamp courses to be completed prior to the workshop: 
  
* Introduction to R
* Introduction to the Tidyverse

Please do your best to have these courses completed by the start of the workshop.
